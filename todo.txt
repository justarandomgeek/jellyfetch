non-admin can't read physicalpaths roots
  so need metadata-ish-based path generation
  {Name} ({Year})/{mediasource.name}
  {SeriesName} ({SeriesYear})/{SeasonName}/{mediasource.name}
  options for characters to exclude from names
more complete nfo files?
  only really needed if info isn't fetched from online
  special episode air order fields would be nice
progress bars to 100% when finished
multiple download streams at once?
prompt before overwriting existing files?
enumerate all files and prompt before downloading?
